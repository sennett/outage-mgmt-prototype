UPTO

- I just: spiked service worker and notifications + Push API/websockets.  https://medium.com/izettle-engineering/beginners-guide-to-web-push-notifications-using-service-workers-cb3474a17679.  did the round trip.
- I just: got the tests passing
- next: add new test to warn when no client ID in client-with-outage-stream, and filter out
- then: save subscription.  postgres local and prod.  knex.  migrations.
