7. pretty page
    - only write service worker when permissions granted (otherwise we are subscribing before asking for )     https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36126541/domexception-registration-failed-permission-denied I had this issue with Chrome after switching from http to https for local dev - needed a new permission for notifications.  I also discovered that you can't ask for notification permission in the service worker itself - you must ask for permission outside of the service worker.
